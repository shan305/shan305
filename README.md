# Hi, I’m Zeeshan Ali 👋

Software Engineer with experience building **reliable backend and distributed systems** across different domains. I focus on designing software that behaves **predictably under load, failure, and concurrency**, and I value clarity, discipline, and correctness over hype.

I come from a **high-responsibility operational background** and bring that mindset into engineering: systems should be understandable, auditable, and resilient.

## What I Work On

- **Backend & Distributed Systems**
  - Designing services that handle concurrency and partial failure
  - Event-driven architectures and asynchronous processing
  - Data consistency, idempotency, and replayability

- **System Design & Infrastructure**
  - API design and service boundaries
  - Databases, messaging systems, and caches
  - Containerized deployments and CI/CD pipelines

- **Security-Aware Engineering**
  - Authorization and access-control flows
  - Defensive design against stale state and race conditions
  - Audit-friendly system behavior

---

## Selected Projects & Work

- **Distributed System Prototypes**
  - Event-based processing pipelines
  - State transition modeling
  - Failure-mode exploration and mitigation

- **Authorization & Consistency Tooling**
  - Tools to surface correctness issues caused by caching, delays, or stale state
  - Focus on making hidden bugs observable

- **Production Backend Services**
  - REST and message-driven services
  - Database-backed systems with strong data integrity requirements

(Fintech systems are part of my experience, not my entire identity.)

## Technical Stack

**Languages**
- Java, C++, Python, TypeScript

**Backend & Data**
- Spring Boot, Node.js, Django
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Kafka and message-driven systems

**Infrastructure**
- Docker, GitHub Actions
- Linux-based deployments
- Cloud-hosted services

---

## How I Think About Engineering

- Prefer explicit state over hidden mutation
- Make failure modes visible
- Design for long-term maintainability
- Build systems that can be reasoned about by other engineers
